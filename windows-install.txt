REQUIREMENTS
============

This application requires 64-bit Windows 7 or newer.

INSTALLING
==========

After unzipping Status.zip, the Status folder can be placed wherever you prefer
(and have permissions) on your computer.

RUNNING
=======

Double-click Status.exe in the Status folder to launch the application.

If you see an error complaining about a DLL file, you should open
vc_redist.x64.exe in the Status\vendor folder to install the Microsoft Visual
C++ Redistributable. This is usually necessary only on versions of Windows
older than Windows 10. Then retry launching the application.

You may wish to right-click Status.exe and "Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)".
The application can then be launched by double-clicking the shortcut on your
desktop.

Status.exe persists settings and encrypted data in your %LOCALAPPDATA%\Status
folder.

UPGRADING
=========

To upgrade this application download the latest Status.zip, delete this Status
folder and the older Status.zip, unzip the newer one, and then place the new
Status folder in your preferred location.

If you place the new Status folder in a different location than the old one
then you should recreate any shortcuts you created for Status.exe.

UNINSTALLING
============

Delete this Status folder and delete your %LOCALAPPDATA%\Status folder.
